Below you will find a **detailed overview** of how these three services—**User Service**, **Order Service**, and **Invoice Service**—together demonstrate a simplified **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** architecture. Each service is independently deployable and utilizes **RabbitMQ** to exchange messages asynchronously. The combined system forms a coherent demo illustrating how CQRS can be implemented in a microservices environment.

# CQRS Demo Overview

**CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern that separates the write side of an application (commands) from the read side (queries). The primary objectives include:

- **Scalability** – The ability to scale read and write workloads independently.
- **Maintainability** – A clear delineation of responsibilities (separate code paths for reads and writes).
- **Extensibility** – The option to introduce event sourcing, different data models for queries and commands, and more sophisticated domain logic.

In this demo:

1. **User Service** handles user and account data (commands and queries for “users” and “accounts”).
2. **Order Service** handles orders (commands and queries for “orders”).
3. **Invoice Service** listens to asynchronous events (from user, account, and order topics) to generate or update invoices (queries for “invoices”).

All three services use **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication. Whenever a **create** event happens (e.g., a new user, account, or order), the responsible service **publishes** an event to RabbitMQ. Other services **listen** for these events and update their own data accordingly. This approach allows the reading side (here, the **Invoice Service**) to maintain a **read-optimized** data model with minimal coupling to the original writer (e.g., the **User** or **Order** service).

# 1. User Service

The **User Service** manages two main entities: **Users** and **Accounts**. It uses **Restify** for its HTTP server and **RabbitMQ** to publish events. 

## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/system-api`.

1. **GET** `/system-api/users`  
   - Retrieve a list of users.  
   - Optional query parameters: `limit`, `offset`, `order_by`.
2. **POST** `/system-api/users`  
   - Create new user(s).  
   - Publishes a `user.created` event to RabbitMQ.
3. **GET** `/system-api/accounts`  
   - Retrieve a list of accounts.  
   - Optional query parameters: `limit`, `offset`, `order_by`.
4. **POST** `/system-api/accounts`  
   - Create new account(s).  
   - Publishes an `account.created` event to RabbitMQ.

### How it Works
1. When a **user** is created, the service writes to its own data store (`demo.users` table) and publishes an **event** of type **`user.created`** with the user’s data to the **`user`** queue in RabbitMQ.
2. When an **account** is created, the service writes to its own data store (`demo.accounts` table) and publishes an **event** of type **`account.created`** to the **`account`** queue.

# 2. Order Service

The **Order Service** handles orders: creating and retrieving them. Like the User Service, it uses **Restify**, has its own database tables (e.g., `demo.orders`), and publishes events to RabbitMQ.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/order-service`.

1. **GET** `/order-service/orders`  
   - Retrieve a list of orders.  
   - Optional query parameters: `limit`, `offset`, `order_by`.
2. **POST** `/order-service/orders`  
   - Create new order(s).  
   - Publishes an **`order.created`** event to the **`order`** queue.

### How it Works
1. A **command** to create an order arrives via an HTTP `POST` request.
2. The service stores the new order (e.g., `demo.orders` table).
3. It publishes an **`order.created`** event with the order’s details (amount, user_id, etc.) to the RabbitMQ **`order`** queue.

---

# 3. Invoice Service

The **Invoice Service** is the **“read side”** in this simplified CQRS demo. It listens to events from the **User** and **Order** services (as well as account-related events) and maintains its own tables for invoices (and references to user shipping/account information).

## Event Consumers

Inside **`AllEvents.js`**, the service initializes **RabbitMQ** consumers for the queues:
- **`user`** – Listens for **`user.created`** events.
- **`account`** – Listens for **`account.created`** events.
- **`order`** – Listens for **`order.created`** events.

### Event Logic
1. **`user.created`**  
   - Creates or updates a user record in an `invoice_account` table (storing email, name, user_id, etc.).
2. **`account.created`**  
   - Updates the `invoice_account` entry with shipping address information for the corresponding user_id.
3. **`order.created`**  
   - Finds or creates a monthly invoice record for the user.  
   - If an invoice does not exist for the `(user_id, month, year)`, it creates one.  
   - Otherwise, it appends the new order details to the existing invoice, recalculating the total.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/invoice-service`.

1. **GET** `/invoice-service/invoices`
   - Retrieve a set of invoices.
   - Query parameters: `user_id`, `month`, `year`.
2. **GET** `/invoice-service/invoices/:id`
   - Retrieve a specific invoice by its ID.

### How it Works
1. On service startup, **AllEvents** connects to RabbitMQ, asserting the relevant queues (order, user, account).  
2. When an event arrives, the service processes it by updating or inserting records in its own **invoice**-related tables (e.g., `demo.invoices`, `demo.invoice_account`).  
3. A **GET** call to `/invoice-service/invoices` merges the relevant invoice data and returns a pre-compiled invoice structure.

# Demo Flow (Putting It All Together)

A common **user journey** to see this CQRS demo in action might look like this:

1. **Create a User**  
   - **POST** `/system-api/users` with JSON body (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@demo.com"}`).  
   - The **User Service** stores the user data, then publishes **`user.created`** to the **`user`** queue.
   - The **Invoice Service** receives `user.created`, adding a new `invoice_account` record.

2. **Create an Account**  
   - **POST** `/system-api/accounts` with JSON body (e.g., `{"user_id": 1, "address1": "123 Main St", "city": "Cityville", ...}`).  
   - The **User Service** stores the new account data, publishes **`account.created`** to the **`account`** queue.
   - The **Invoice Service** receives `account.created` and updates the `invoice_account` entry for user_id=1 with the new shipping address.

3. **Create an Order**  
   - **POST** `/order-service/orders` with JSON body (e.g., `{"user_id": 1, "amount": 50, "description": "Test purchase"}`).  
   - The **Order Service** stores the order data, publishes **`order.created`** to the **`order`** queue.
   - The **Invoice Service** receives `order.created`:
     - Locates the user’s `invoice_account` entry.  
     - Locates or creates the invoice for the correct `(user_id, month, year)`.  
     - Appends the new order details to the invoice and updates the total.

4. **Retrieve Invoice**  
   - **GET** `/invoice-service/invoices?user_id=1&month=4&year=2025`.  
   - The **Invoice Service** returns the invoice record for user_id=1 for April 2025, including all orders, shipping address, and total amount.

Throughout this flow, each service is **independently responsible** for its own data model. The **User** and **Order** services handle the primary “write” operations, while the **Invoice** service handles the “read” operations in a specialized format (monthly invoices, shipping address caching, etc.). Messages in RabbitMQ provide **asynchronous** communication, enabling eventual consistency.

# Why CQRS?

**CQRS** is beneficial when:

1. **Read and Write Loads Differ**: If reads vastly outnumber writes, having a separate query model can improve performance and scalability.
2. **Complex Business Logic**: Commands can be handled independently of read queries, allowing for more complex or asynchronous business logic on writes.
3. **Event Sourcing / Reactivity**: By publishing and listening to domain events, other services can react to changes without being tightly coupled.

---

# Conclusion

This **CQRS Demo** presents a **basic microservices** approach to separating read concerns from write concerns:

- **User Service**: Manages user and account data, publishes `user.created` / `account.created`.
- **Order Service**: Manages order data, publishes `order.created`.
- **Invoice Service**: Listens for user/account/order events to build a read-optimized monthly invoice model.

The system uses **RabbitMQ** for **asynchronous** event-based communication, ensuring services remain loosely coupled. This pattern allows each service to handle its own domain logic, while the **Invoice Service** maintains a specialized view for querying invoice data.

Feel free to extend or customize these services to meet the needs of more complex or domain-specific applications. This demo can serve as a **blueprint** for how you might implement a **CQRS architecture** with **microservices** and **event-driven** communication in a real-world system.
